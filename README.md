# Singularity Wars

Singularity Wars is a space-themed game where the player begins their journey in a spaceship and travels freely across space. Along the journey the player will encounter alien pirates, space rocks and three kinds of phenomena that involve strong gravitational effects and spacetime curvature. The player can upgrade their ship and weapons by eliminating enemies and exploring space.

## Description

- Free-roam space exploration with dynamic hazards and enemies.
- Upgradeable ship and weapons through combat and exploration rewards.
- Randomly spawning space features that alter movement and strategy.

## Features

- Free movement across a virtual 2D/3D space.
- Alien ships that attempt to destroy the player by collision or firing; alien ships are immune to damage from space rocks.
- Space rocks spawning randomly in unexplored regions; they damage the player on collision, can block bullets, and can be destroyed after taking a certain amount of fire.
- Weapon upgrades unlocked by eliminating a certain number of alien ships. Upgrades may include higher damage, faster fire rate, faster projectile speed, and special effects.
- Ship upgrades earned by defeating enemies, destroying space rocks, and traveling through wormholes. Upgraded ships may gain higher top speed and greater hit points.
- Space phenomena that spawn randomly in unexplored regions:
	- Black holes: attract nearby objects; larger black holes exert stronger attraction and can damage the player if approached too closely.
	- White holes: repulse nearby objects and can alter the ship's trajectory.
	- Wormholes: transport players instantly to unexplored regions and grant points used for upgrades.
- Dynamic difficulty: the game scales with the player's score, spawning more and tougher enemies over time.
- Toggleable first-person and third-person views.
- Post-game scoreboard showing the top 5 scores and the score from the last played round.
